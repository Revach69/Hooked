# Match Alert Fix - Mobile Apps

## Problem Description
User A (Android user) liked User B (iOS user), and when User B liked User A back, User B received 12 "It's a Match" alerts instead of one. User B had to click "Continue Browsing" 12 times to be able to use the app.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by multiple match alert triggers across different parts of the app:

1. **Discovery Page**: Mutual matches listener was triggering alerts
2. **Matches Page**: Mutual matches listener was also triggering alerts  
3. **Like Action**: Immediate toast notification when creating a match
4. **No Duplicate Prevention**: No mechanism to prevent multiple alerts for the same match

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Centralized Match Alert Service (`lib/matchAlertService.ts`)
Created a new service to handle all match alerts consistently:

- **`showMatchAlert()`**: Shows native alert with two buttons:
  - "Continue Browsing" (closes alert)
  - "See Match" (redirects to matches page)
- **`showMatchToast()`**: Shows toast notification for discovery page
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Tracks active alerts to prevent duplicates
- **Cleanup Functions**: Clear active alerts when components unmount

### 2. Updated Discovery Page (`app/discovery.tsx`)
- Replaced direct Alert.alert and Toast.show calls with centralized service
- Added duplicate prevention checks
- Added cleanup on component unmount

### 3. Updated Matches Page (`app/matches.tsx`)
- Replaced direct Alert.alert calls with centralized service
- Added duplicate prevention checks
- Added cleanup on component unmount

### 4. Key Features
- **Two-Button Alert**: "Continue Browsing" and "See Match" options
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Uses unique keys to track active alerts
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Same behavior on both Android and iOS
- **Proper Cleanup**: Clears active alerts when components unmount

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- Created test file to verify functionality
- Duplicate prevention mechanism tested

## Files Modified
1. `lib/matchAlertService.ts` (new file)
2. `app/discovery.tsx`
3. `app/matches.tsx`
4. `lib/matchAlertService.test.ts` (new test file)

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- Users will see exactly **one** match alert per mutual match
- Alert will have two buttons: "Continue Browsing" and "See Match"
- "Continue Browsing" closes the alert
- "See Match" navigates to the matches page
- No more duplicate alerts or multiple popups
- Consistent behavior across Android and iOS platforms
