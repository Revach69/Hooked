## üü† Edge Cases & Negative Testing

### 1. Invalid Event Code

### 4. Network/Offline Scenarios
- [ ] Turn off internet connection and try to perform actions (like, message, update profile).
- [ ] Reconnect and verify pending actions are synced or appropriate errors are shown.

### 5. Session & Auth
