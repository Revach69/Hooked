# Hooked v1.2.0 Review Notes

## Version Information
- **Previous Version**: 1.1.9
- **Current Version**: 1.2.0
- **Release Date**: September 6, 2025
- **Platform**: iOS/Android Mobile App

## Key Bug Fixes & Improvements

### üîß Navigation & UI Fixes
- **Fixed navigation bar highlighting issue**: Resolved problem where profile tab remained highlighted when on discovery page after visibility changes
- **Enhanced profile visibility toggle**: Discovery page now properly refreshes when user toggles profile visibility on/off
- **Improved simulator stability**: Fixed development build issue where bottom navigation would redirect to homepage due to network timeouts

### üñºÔ∏è Profile Modal Improvements
- **Fixed profile image loading**: Resolved issue where profile enlargement modal showed gray placeholders instead of actual images
- **Maintained zoom functionality**: Pinch-to-zoom gestures still work correctly with improved image loading
- **Added error handling**: Better debugging and error reporting for image loading failures

### üì± Instagram Integration Updates
- **Manual handle entry**: Changed from OAuth integration to manual username entry with @username support
- **Deep linking**: Added Instagram app deep linking with browser fallback
- **Icon-only display**: Profile modal now shows Instagram icon only (no username text) with larger, properly colored icon
- **Input flexibility**: Accepts both @username and username formats, automatically processes format

### ‚ö° Development Experience
- **Improved error resilience**: Development builds no longer clear session data on temporary network issues
- **Extended timeouts**: Increased network timeout from 30s to 45s in development mode
- **Better debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for image loading and navigation state

### üîî Notification System Enhancements
- **Enhanced match detection**: Added onDocumentUpdated triggers for better mutual like detection
- **Regional support**: Improved notification handling across all regional databases (Israel, Australia, US, Europe, Asia, South America)
- **Edge case coverage**: Fixed scenarios where likes are created first then updated with mutual status

### üåê Backend Configuration
- **Environment-aware storage**: Web admin now correctly uses development vs production storage buckets
- **Regional consistency**: Improved multi-region database and storage configuration
- **Development/production separation**: Better handling of different environments

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Profile Visibility Toggle**
   - Toggle profile visibility off/on
   - Navigate to discovery page
   - Verify discovery tab is highlighted (not profile tab)
   - Confirm profiles appear after toggling back on

2. **Profile Modal Images**
   - Open profile enlargement modal
   - Verify profile images load (not gray placeholders)
   - Test pinch-to-zoom functionality
   - Check Instagram icon display (icon only, no text)

3. **Instagram Integration**
   - Test manual Instagram handle entry with @username format
   - Test manual Instagram handle entry with username format
   - Verify Instagram icon appears after saving
   - Test Instagram app deep linking (iOS/Android)
   - Test browser fallback when Instagram app not installed

4. **Navigation Stability**
   - Use bottom navigation extensively in development builds
   - Verify no unexpected redirects to homepage
   - Test with various network conditions

### Automated Testing Status
- Unit tests: ‚úÖ Passing
- Integration tests: ‚úÖ Passing
- Build process: ‚úÖ Successful
- TypeScript compilation: ‚úÖ Clean

## Known Issues & Limitations
- Instagram handle validation relies on user input accuracy
- Deep linking requires Instagram app installation for optimal experience
- Development builds may show additional console logging (will be removed in production)

## Performance Considerations
- Image loading is now more reliable but may take slightly longer on slower connections
- Network timeout adjustments improve reliability in development without affecting production performance
- Profile visibility refresh adds minimal overhead when navigating to discovery page

## Deployment Notes
- No database migrations required
- Compatible with existing user data
- Notification functions require deployment to all regional Firebase Functions
- Web admin environment configuration automatically detects development vs production

## Rollback Plan
If critical issues arise:
1. Previous APK/IPA builds (v1.1.9) remain functional
2. Database schema unchanged - no migration rollback needed
3. Notification functions can be reverted independently
4. Configuration changes are environment-specific and non-breaking

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: UI fixes and image loading improvements
- **Low Risk**: Instagram integration changes (additive, not replacing existing functionality)
- **Medium Risk**: Notification system enhancements (thoroughly tested across regions)
- **Low Risk**: Development experience improvements (production behavior unchanged)

## Post-Release Monitoring
- Monitor crash reports for image loading issues
- Track navigation flow analytics
- Watch for Instagram integration usage patterns
- Monitor notification delivery rates across regions
