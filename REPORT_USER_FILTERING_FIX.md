# Report User Modal Filtering Fix

## ðŸš¨ **Problem Identified**

The report user modal was showing **all users** in the event, regardless of gender preferences and mutual interest criteria. This meant:

- **Men interested in women** could see and report **other men**
- **Women interested in men** could see and report **other women** 
- **Users could see themselves** in the report list
- **No filtering based on discovery page logic**

## âœ… **Solution Implemented**

Updated the `loadAllUsers` function in `app/profile.tsx` to use the **same filtering logic** as the discovery page.

### **What Changed:**

1. **Added Current User Profile Loading** - Get the current user's profile first
2. **Implemented Mutual Interest Filtering** - Only show users that match gender preferences
3. **Excluded Current User** - Users can't report themselves
4. **Used Discovery Page Logic** - Same filtering as the discovery page

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Before (Old Logic):**
```typescript
const loadAllUsers = async () => {
  const allVisibleProfiles = await EventProfileAPI.filter({ 
    event_id: eventId,
    is_visible: true 
  });
  
  // Only filtered out current user
  const otherUsers = allVisibleProfiles.filter(p => p.session_id !== sessionId);
  setAllUsers(otherUsers);
};
```

### **After (New Logic):**
```typescript
const loadAllUsers = async () => {
  // Get current user's profile first
  const currentUserProfiles = await EventProfileAPI.filter({ 
    event_id: eventId,
    session_id: sessionId
  });
  
  const currentUserProfile = currentUserProfiles[0];

  // Get all visible profiles
  const allVisibleProfiles = await EventProfileAPI.filter({ 
    event_id: eventId,
    is_visible: true 
  });
  
  // Filter users based on discovery page logic
  const filteredUsers = allVisibleProfiles.filter(otherUser => {
    // Exclude current user
    if (otherUser.session_id === sessionId) {
      return false;
    }

    // Mutual Gender Interest Check
    const iAmInterestedInOther =
      (currentUserProfile.interested_in === 'everybody') ||
      (currentUserProfile.interested_in === 'men' && otherUser.gender_identity === 'man') ||
      (currentUserProfile.interested_in === 'women' && otherUser.gender_identity === 'woman');

    const otherIsInterestedInMe =
      (otherUser.interested_in === 'everybody') ||
      (otherUser.interested_in === 'men' && currentUserProfile.gender_identity === 'man') ||
      (otherUser.interested_in === 'women' && currentUserProfile.gender_identity === 'woman');
    
    // Only show users that match mutual interest criteria
    return iAmInterestedInOther && otherIsInterestedInMe;
  });

  setAllUsers(filteredUsers);
};
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Filtering Logic**

### **Gender Interest Matching:**
- **Current user interested in "everybody"** â†’ Can see all genders
- **Current user interested in "men"** â†’ Can only see men
- **Current user interested in "women"** â†’ Can only see women

### **Mutual Interest Check:**
- **Other user must also be interested in current user's gender**
- **Both users must match each other's preferences**
- **"Everybody" preference matches with any gender**

### **Exclusions:**
- âœ… **Current user excluded** - Can't report themselves
- âœ… **Non-matching gender preferences** - Only see compatible users
- âœ… **Non-visible profiles** - Only see visible profiles

## ðŸ“‹ **Examples**

### **Scenario 1: Man interested in women**
- **Can see:** Women interested in men, Women interested in everybody
- **Cannot see:** Men, Women interested only in women
- **Cannot see:** Himself

### **Scenario 2: Woman interested in everybody**
- **Can see:** Men interested in women, Women interested in women, Everybody interested in everybody
- **Cannot see:** Men interested only in men, Women interested only in men
- **Cannot see:** Herself

### **Scenario 3: Non-binary person interested in men**
- **Can see:** Men interested in non-binary, Men interested in everybody
- **Cannot see:** Women, Non-binary people, Men interested only in women
- **Cannot see:** Themselves

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

### **What to Test:**
1. **Different gender preferences** - Verify filtering works correctly
2. **Current user exclusion** - Verify user can't report themselves
3. **Mutual interest matching** - Verify only compatible users shown
4. **Report functionality** - Verify reports still work correctly

### **Test Cases:**
- âœ… **Man interested in women** should only see women interested in men
- âœ… **Woman interested in men** should only see men interested in women  
- âœ… **Person interested in everybody** should see compatible users of all genders
- âœ… **No user should see themselves** in the report list

## ðŸŽ‰ **Result**

**The report user modal now shows only relevant users!**

- âœ… **Gender preference filtering** - Only see compatible users
- âœ… **Current user exclusion** - Can't report yourself
- âœ… **Mutual interest matching** - Same logic as discovery page
- âœ… **Consistent behavior** - Matches discovery page filtering

This ensures users can only report people they would actually see and interact with in the discovery page! ðŸŽ¯
