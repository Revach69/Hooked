# Notification System Architecture Change
## From Server-Side State Management to Client-Side Decision Making

Date: 2025-01-03

---

## Overview
Complete overhaul of the notification system from a complex server-side state management approach to a simple client-side decision making pattern, following industry standards used by WhatsApp and Instagram.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Firebase Functions - Removed State Checking from Notification Processing
**Before:** Server checked `app_states` collection before sending notifications
**After:** Server always sends notifications, client decides display

### 2. Firebase Functions - Simplified Push Token Registration
**Before:** `savePushToken` required `eventId` parameter
**After:** `savePushToken` accepts optional `eventId`, fallback to default database

### 3. Client-Side - Implemented Local Notification Handling
**Before:** Complex state management with WebSocket connections
**After:** Simple client-side logic in `_layout.tsx` notification handlers

### 4. Deprecated App State Management
**Before:** `AppStateSyncService` tracked foreground/background state
**After:** App state functions deprecated, client handles display decisions

- **Fix:** Removed incorrect `backgroundMessageHandler.js` - Expo handles background processing automatically
- **Impact:** iOS notifications now work correctly from background/killed states

### ‚úÖ 2. Token Refresh Handling - FIXED  
- **Issue:** No push token refresh mechanism for app updates
- **Fix:** Added `setupTokenRefreshHandler()` with `Notifications.addPushTokenListener`
- **Location:** `AppInitializationService.ts:496-551`
- **Impact:** Prevents stale tokens = missed notifications after app updates

### ‚úÖ 3. Platform-Specific Permission Handling - ENHANCED
- **Issue:** Basic permission handling without iOS provisional support
- **Fix:** Enhanced permission checks with iOS provisional authorization support
- **Location:** `registerPushToken.ts:20-99`  
- **Impact:** Better permission handling on iOS 12+ and Android 13+

### ‚úÖ 4. Notification Tap When App is Killed - FIXED
- **Issue:** No handling for notifications that opened app from killed state
- **Fix:** Added `getLastNotificationResponseAsync()` with navigation delay
- **Location:** `_layout.tsx:359-430`
- **Impact:** Deep linking works correctly from killed state with 1.5s navigation delay

### ‚úÖ 5. Rate Limiting & Batch Processing - ENHANCED
- **Issue:** No rate limiting between notification batches  
- **Fix:** Added 50ms delay between batches for large sends
- **Location:** `functions/src/index.ts:807-814`
- **Impact:** Prevents overwhelming Expo push servers

### ‚úÖ 6. Database Region Matching - VERIFIED  
- **Issue:** Risk of push tokens in wrong regional database
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Already correctly implemented - tokens stored in same region as events
- **Location:** `functions/src/index.ts:1898-1906` & `1022`
- **Impact:** No region mismatches, optimal notification delivery

### ‚úÖ 7. Deduplication Memory Leak Prevention - FIXED
- **Issue:** Unbounded growth of notification ID cache
- **Fix:** Added 100-item limit with FIFO cleanup
- **Location:** `_layout.tsx:140-166`  
- **Impact:** Prevents memory leaks in long-running app sessions

### ‚úÖ 8. Silent Push Throttling for iOS - IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue:** No throttling for iOS silent push limitations (2-3/hour)
- **Fix:** Added 20-minute throttling with Firestore tracking
- **Location:** `functions/src/index.ts:875-962`
- **Impact:** Respects iOS limits, prevents silent push blocking

## ‚úÖ PERSONALIZED MATCH NOTIFICATIONS IMPLEMENTED

### Enhanced Match Notification Text
- **Updated Title**: `"You got Hooked with {partnerName}!"` (instead of generic "You got Hooked!")
- **Updated Body**: `"Start chatting now!"` (instead of "Start chatting!")
- **Partner Name Lookup**: Server now fetches partner names from event_profiles collection for personalized notifications

### Client-Side Notification Display Logic Verified ‚úÖ
- **In-App Users (Foreground)**: Receive in-app Toast notifications with partner name
- **Background Users**: Receive system push notifications with partner name
- **Navigation**: Tapping notifications correctly navigates to chat with partner name and session ID
- **Killed State**: App launched from notification correctly navigates with partner context

### Technical Implementation
- **Server**: `mutualLikeHandler` now fetches both user names from event_profiles before creating notification jobs
- **Client**: Updated notification handlers to use `partnerSessionId` and `partnerName` fields consistently
- **Fallback**: If name lookup fails, falls back to "Someone" to prevent notification failures

**üéØ RESULT:** Match notifications are now personalized with partner names and the client correctly handles foreground vs background display logic following WhatsApp/Instagram patterns.
