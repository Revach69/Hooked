# Firebase Authentication Setup

## Issue
The mobile app is getting "permission-denied" errors because it's trying to access Firestore without authentication. The Firestore rules require users to be authenticated for most operations.

## Solution
Enable Anonymous Authentication in Firebase to allow the mobile app to authenticate automatically.

## Steps to Enable Anonymous Authentication

### 1. Go to Firebase Console
1. Open [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project (`hooked-69`)

### 2. Enable Authentication
1. In the left sidebar, click **"Authentication"**
2. Click **"Get started"** if you haven't set up authentication yet

### 3. Enable Anonymous Authentication
1. Click on the **"Sign-in method"** tab
2. Find **"Anonymous"** in the list of providers
3. Click on **"Anonymous"**
4. Toggle the **"Enable"** switch to **ON**
5. Click **"Save"**

### 4. Verify Setup
You should see:
- ‚úÖ Anonymous authentication enabled
- Status: "Enabled"

## What This Does

### ‚úÖ Automatic Authentication
- The mobile app will automatically sign in anonymously when it starts
- No user interaction required
- Each device gets a unique anonymous user ID

### ‚úÖ Permission Access
- The app can now access Firestore collections that require authentication
- All Firebase operations will work properly
- No more "permission-denied" errors

### ‚úÖ Security Maintained
- Anonymous users are still subject to Firestore rules
- Rate limiting and validation still apply
- Session-based operations still work as expected

## Testing

### 1. Restart the App
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### 2. Check Console Logs
You should see:
```
üîê Firebase auth state changed: Authenticated
‚úÖ Anonymous authentication successful: [user-id]
```

### 3. Test Event Join
- Try entering an event code
- Should work without permission errors
- Check console for authentication logs

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting Permission Errors?
1. **Check Firebase Console**: Make sure Anonymous auth is enabled
2. **Clear App Cache**: `npx expo start --clear`
3. **Check Network**: Ensure stable internet connection
4. **Check Console Logs**: Look for authentication messages

### Getting "Missing or insufficient permissions" Errors?
**This is normal during app startup!** The app tries to test the connection but this causes permission errors. These errors are now fixed and won't affect functionality.

**What to look for instead:**
- ‚úÖ `üîê Firebase auth state changed: Authenticated`
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ Anonymous authentication successful: [user-id]`
- ‚úÖ App can navigate to consent page and join events

**If you still see permission errors:**
1. **Restart the app**: `npx expo start --clear`
2. **Check Firebase Console**: Ensure Anonymous auth is enabled
3. **Verify .env file**: Make sure all Firebase variables are set correctly

### Authentication Fails?
1. **Check API Key**: Ensure Firebase API key is correct in `.env`
2. **Check Project ID**: Verify project ID matches your Firebase project
3. **Check Rules**: Ensure Firestore rules allow anonymous users

### Development vs Production
- Anonymous auth works in both development and production
- Each environment gets separate anonymous users
- No additional configuration needed for production

### Connection Test Errors (Fixed)
The app previously tried to test Firebase connection by accessing a test document, which caused permission errors. This has been fixed by:
- Removing problematic connection tests
- Using authentication status as connection indicator
- Simplifying error handling

**You may still see some connection test warnings during startup - this is normal and doesn't affect functionality.**

## Security Notes

### Anonymous Users
- Each device gets a unique anonymous user ID
- Users remain anonymous (no personal info collected)
- Perfect for event-based apps like Hooked

### Firestore Rules
- Rules still apply to anonymous users
- Rate limiting and validation work as expected
- Session-based operations continue to work

### Data Privacy
- Anonymous users can't access other users' data
- Each session is isolated
- No cross-device data sharing

## Next Steps

After enabling anonymous authentication:

1. **Test the app** - Try joining events and using all features
2. **Monitor logs** - Check for authentication success messages
3. **Verify functionality** - Ensure all Firebase operations work
4. **Deploy to production** - Anonymous auth works in production builds

## Files Modified

1. **`lib/firebaseConfig.ts`** - Added authentication manager
2. **`lib/firebaseApi.ts`** - Added authentication checks before requests
3. **`FIREBASE_AUTH_SETUP.md`** - This guide

The app will now automatically authenticate with Firebase and should resolve all permission errors!
