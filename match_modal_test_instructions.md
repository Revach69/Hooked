# Match Alert Modal - Implementation Complete

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. Custom Match Alert Modal (`MatchAlertModal.tsx`)
- **Beautiful animated modal** similar to profile enlargement modal
- **"Start Chatting" button** with chat navigation
- **Swipe to dismiss** gesture support
- **Tap outside to close** functionality 
- **Smooth animations** with entrance/exit transitions
- **Dark mode support**
- **Accessibility features**

### 2. Integration in _layout.tsx
- **Replaced match toast** with custom modal for foreground notifications
- **State management** for modal visibility and partner data
- **Navigation handling** to specific chat when "Start Chatting" pressed
- **Fallback handling** if partner data is missing

### 3. User Experience
- **Foreground match notifications** now show custom modal instead of toast
- **Background notifications** still show push notifications (unchanged)
- **Tapped notifications** go directly to chat (unchanged)
- **Message notifications** still use toast (unchanged)
