Major Changes & Fixes in mobile-app/ Since Last Git Push
========================================================

1. Integration of Device Info and Native Modules
------------------------------------------------
We introduced or updated the use of the `react-native-device-info` package (or similar device info utilities) to access device-specific information such as unique IDs, OS version, and device model. This involved adding new imports, updating initialization logic, and possibly using new hooks or context to provide device data throughout the app. Native project files (iOS/Android) may have been updated to ensure the package was properly linked and configured, introducing new dependencies or build steps.

**Related files:**
- app/_layout.tsx
- package.json
- ios/Hooked.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
- ios/Podfile.lock
- android/app/build.gradle (if changed)

2. Notification System Updates
------------------------------
Significant changes were made to how notifications are handled in the app, including updates to Expo Notifications and Firebase Cloud Messaging integration. We refactored push token registration, improved notification routing and handling, and possibly added a new messaging service. These changes aimed to improve reliability, support new notification features, or fix issues with receiving or displaying notifications on different devices.
