# Mapbox Integration Deployment Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the staged rollout strategy for the Mapbox integration feature, ensuring safe and controlled deployment to production with minimal risk to users.

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Feature Branch Development (Current)
**Timeline**: In Progress  
**Scope**: Development team only  
**Environment**: `feature/mapbox-integration` branch

**Objectives**:
- Complete feature development and testing
- Validate Mapbox SDK integration
- Ensure CI/CD pipeline stability
- Perform initial performance testing

**Success Criteria**:
- All tests pass consistently
- Feature branch builds successfully
- Maps load without errors in development
- Performance metrics within acceptable bounds

### Phase 2: Internal Alpha Testing
**Timeline**: Post-development completion  
**Scope**: Internal team members (5-10 users)  
**Environment**: Development environment with feature flag

**Objectives**:
- Validate core map functionality
- Test location services integration
- Verify user experience flows
- Identify edge cases and performance issues

**Feature Flag Configuration**:
```typescript
MAPBOX_FEATURE_ENABLED: {
  development: true,
  staging: false,
  production: false
}
```

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero critical bugs in core functionality
- Performance impact < 5% on app startup
- Location accuracy within acceptable range
- User feedback positive (80%+ satisfaction)

### Phase 3: Staging Environment Testing
**Timeline**: After Phase 2 completion  
**Scope**: QA team and select beta testers (25-50 users)  
**Environment**: Staging environment

**Objectives**:
- Full integration testing with staging backend
- Load testing with multiple concurrent users
- Cross-platform compatibility validation
- Security and privacy compliance verification

**Deployment Process**:
1. Merge feature branch to `staging`
2. Enable staging environment feature flag
3. Deploy via staging CI/CD pipeline
4. Monitor performance metrics
5. Collect user feedback

**Success Criteria**:
- No regression in existing functionality
- Map performance acceptable under load
- Security audit passes
- Beta tester approval (85%+ satisfaction)

### Phase 4: Production Canary Release (5%)
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks after staging approval  
**Scope**: 5% of production users (gradual rollout)  
**Environment**: Production with feature flag

**Objectives**:
- Validate real-world usage patterns
- Monitor system performance at scale
- Detect any production-specific issues
- Gather initial user adoption metrics

**Feature Flag Configuration**:
```typescript
MAPBOX_FEATURE_ENABLED: {
  production: {
    enabled: true,
    rolloutPercentage: 5,
    userCriteria: ['new_users', 'beta_opted_in']
  }
}
```

**Monitoring Requirements**:
- Real-time error rate monitoring
- Performance impact tracking
- API usage and cost monitoring
- User engagement metrics

**Rollback Criteria**:
- Error rate increase > 1%
- Performance degradation > 10%
- Critical security issue discovered
- User complaints > 15% of exposed users

### Phase 5: Production Gradual Rollout
**Timeline**: Progressive increases every 3-7 days  
**Scope**: 5% → 15% → 35% → 65% → 100%  
**Environment**: Production

**Rollout Schedule**:
- Week 1: 5% of users
- Week 2: 15% of users (if metrics healthy)
- Week 3: 35% of users (if metrics healthy)
- Week 4: 65% of users (if metrics healthy)
- Week 5: 100% of users (full deployment)

**Success Metrics per Phase**:
- Error rate < 0.5% increase
- User satisfaction > 80%
- Performance impact < 5%
- Cost within budget projections

## Feature Flag Implementation

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Feature flag control
EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_FEATURE_ENABLED=true
EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE=5

# Fallback behavior
EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_FALLBACK_MODE=list_view
```

### Code Implementation Pattern
```typescript
const isMapboxEnabled = () => {
  const featureEnabled = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_FEATURE_ENABLED === 'true';
  const rolloutPercentage = parseInt(process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE || '0');
  const userHash = getUserRolloutHash(); // Deterministic hash for consistency
  
  return featureEnabled && (userHash % 100) < rolloutPercentage;
};
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Mapbox API Failures**
   - Mitigation: Graceful fallback to list view
   - Monitoring: API response time and error rates

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Mitigation: Lazy loading and progressive enhancement
   - Monitoring: App startup time and memory usage

3. **Location Privacy Concerns**
   - Mitigation: Clear user consent and minimal data collection
   - Monitoring: User opt-out rates

4. **Third-party Dependency Risk**
   - Mitigation: Version pinning and regular updates
   - Monitoring: SDK stability and security advisories

### Operational Risks
1. **Increased Infrastructure Costs**
   - Mitigation: Usage monitoring and budget alerts
   - Monitoring: Daily API usage and billing metrics

2. **User Experience Disruption**
   - Mitigation: A/B testing and gradual rollout
   - Monitoring: User session completion rates

3. **Support Burden**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation and FAQ
   - Monitoring: Support ticket volume and topics

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback (Emergency)
- Disable feature flag via environment variable update
- Redeploy application without Mapbox integration
- Timeline: < 30 minutes

### Gradual Rollback
- Reduce rollout percentage incrementally
- Monitor metrics at each reduction step
- Timeline: Over 24-48 hours

### Complete Rollback
- Remove feature flag and Mapbox code
- Revert to previous stable release
- Timeline: 2-4 hours including testing

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Technical**: Error rate, response time, memory usage
- **Business**: User engagement, feature adoption, support tickets
- **Cost**: API usage, infrastructure spend

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: Error rate > 2% increase
- **Warning**: Performance degradation > 5%
- **Info**: Cost increase > 20% from baseline

### Monitoring Tools
- **Performance**: Application monitoring dashboard
- **Errors**: Error tracking and alerting system
- **Business**: Analytics and user behavior tracking
- **Cost**: Mapbox usage dashboard and billing alerts
