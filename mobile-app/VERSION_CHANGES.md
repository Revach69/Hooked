  - Cleanup scripts for development data

### üîÑ **Workflow & Environment Switching**
- [x] Environment switching commands ready:
  ```bash

  npm run env:prod   # Production
  ```
- [x] Firebase project switching integrated
- [x] EAS build configurations for both environments

### üèóÔ∏è **Build Configuration**
- [ ] **Development builds** use `app.development.json`

### üöÄ **Pre-Release Production Checklist**

Before deploying v1.1.0 to production:

#### Required Actions:
1. [ ] Install `expo-image-manipulator` in production environment
2. [ ] Verify all production EAS secrets are configured
3. [ ] Ensure production Firebase Cloud Functions are up to date
4. [ ] Test production builds use correct `app.json` configuration
5. [ ] Verify production Sentry project receives error reports correctly
6. [ ] Test environment switching works in production CI/CD

#### Optional/Development Only (DO NOT deploy to production):
- [ ] Mock profile generation scripts (keep in dev only)
- [ ] Test event data (keep in development Firebase only)
- [ ] `app.development.json` file (development builds only)

### üîç **Testing Verification**
Before production release, verify:
- [ ] Production builds connect to production Firebase
- [ ] Development builds connect to development Firebase
- [ ] Photo upload works in both environments
- [ ] Push notifications work in both environments
- [ ] Error reporting goes to correct Sentry projects
- [ ] No cross-environment data contamination
