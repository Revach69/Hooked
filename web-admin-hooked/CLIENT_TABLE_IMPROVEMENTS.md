# Client Table Structure Recommendations

## Current Issues & Proposed Solutions

### 1. Missing Admin Notes Display
**Problem**: `adminNotes` field isn't visible, but it's crucial for client context.
**Solution**: Add an "Notes" column or expand the hover tooltip to show notes summary.

### 2. No Merge History Visibility  
**Problem**: When clients are merged, there's no indication of merge history.
**Solution**: Add visual indicators for merged clients:
- Badge showing "Merged (3)" for clients with merged data
- In expanded view, show alternate contacts and merge history
- Audit trail section in expanded view

### 3. Limited Contact Information
**Problem**: Only primary phone/email shown, missing alternates from merged clients.
**Solution**: 
- Show "+" indicator when alternateEmails/alternatePhones exist
- In expanded view or tooltip, display all contact methods

### 4. No Timestamp Information
**Problem**: No visibility into when clients were created or last updated.
**Solution**: Add "Created" and "Last Updated" columns (optional, hideable)

### 5. No Creator Attribution
**Problem**: Can't see who created the client.
**Solution**: Add "Created By" field in expanded view or tooltip

## Recommended New Column Structure

### Main Table Columns:
1. **Expand** (chevron)
2. **Name** (unchanged)
3. **Type** (unchanged) 
4. **Event Types** (unchanged)
5. **POC Name** (unchanged)
6. **Contacts** (enhanced to show primary + count of alternates)
7. **Country** (unchanged)
8. **Status** (unchanged)
9. **Source** (unchanged)
10. **Notes** (new - show first 50 chars of adminNotes)
11. **Actions** (enhanced with merge indicators)

### Enhanced Expanded View:
- **Current Events Table** (unchanged)
- **Contact Methods Section**: All emails and phones
- **Admin History Section**: Recent audit trail entries
- **Merge Information**: If merged, show source clients and merge date

## Website Form Submission Analysis

### Current Behavior Investigation
Based on PRD references to `/api/eventform/route.ts` and `saveEventForm` function:

**Finding**: The website form submission logic is likely handled by:
1. Cloud functions not in this codebase
2. Separate microservice
3. The actual Hooked website codebase (not this admin dashboard)

### Recommendation for Form Submissions

**Current Problem**: Website "Contact Form" submissions might auto-create clients without admin oversight.

**Proposed Solution**: Create a new subsection in Forms tab called **"Contact Form Submissions"**:

1. **Separate from Event Forms**: Don't mix contact inquiries with event submissions
2. **Admin Review Process**: Contact forms create entries that require admin action
3. **Convert to Client**: Admin can review and convert worthy contacts to full clients
4. **Spam Protection**: Admin can dismiss spam/invalid submissions

### Implementation Approach:
1. Create `ContactFormSubmission` type separate from `EventForm`
2. Add new tab/section in Forms page: "Contact Submissions"
3. Provide actions: Convert to Client, Dismiss, Mark as Spam
4. Track conversion rates and submission quality

## Priority Implementation Order:

### Phase 1 (High Priority):
1. Add adminNotes column/display
2. Add merge indicators and alternate contact display
3. Contact form submissions subsection

### Phase 2 (Medium Priority):  
1. Audit trail in expanded view
2. Creator attribution
3. Timestamp columns (optional/hideable)

### Phase 3 (Enhancement):
1. Advanced filtering by merge status, creation date, etc.
2. Bulk operations on contact submissions
3. Analytics on contact form conversion rates
