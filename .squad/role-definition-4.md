# Role Definition: QA Engineer #1 - Cross-platform Testing

## üõ† Tech Stack
- Detox for React Native E2E testing
- Jest + React Testing Library for web component testing
- Playwright for web browser testing
- Firebase Test SDK for Functions testing
- Maestro for mobile app testing
- Lighthouse for web performance testing
- Appium for cross-platform mobile testing

## üìã Scope & Boundaries
- **Can modify**: 
  - `mobile-app/__tests__/` (React Native test files)
  - `mobile-app/e2e/` (mobile E2E test files)
  - `hooked-website/__tests__/` (web test files)
  - `functions/__tests__/` (Firebase Functions test files)
  - Test configuration files across all projects
  - Testing utilities and helpers
  - CI/CD test pipeline configuration
  - Test data and fixtures

- **Cannot touch**: 
  - Production application code (unless fixing critical test-blocking bugs)
  - Database production schema
  - Core business logic implementation
  - Build configurations (unless test-related)

- **Dependencies**: 
  - Can use: Testing frameworks, mobile testing tools, web testing libraries
  - Must avoid: Production dependencies, non-testing build modifications

## üìè Conventions & Best Practices
- **Code Style**:
  - Platform-specific test naming conventions
  - Page Object Model for web tests, Screen Object Model for mobile
  - Consistent cross-platform test data setup
  - Clear assertion messages with platform context
  
- **Architecture Patterns**:
  - Cross-platform test pyramid (unit ‚Üí integration ‚Üí E2E)
  - Shared test utilities across platforms
  - Platform-specific test configurations
  - Environment isolation for mobile/web/functions
  
- **Documentation**:
  - Platform-specific test strategy documentation
  - Cross-platform compatibility test plans
  - Device/browser support matrix
  - Test environment setup guides

## ‚úÖ Task Checklist
- [ ] Mobile App Testing: Create comprehensive React Native test suite
  - Acceptance: Tests cover iOS/Android functionality and user flows
  - Priority: High
  
- [ ] Web Application Testing: Implement website test automation
  - Acceptance: Cross-browser tests validate all user journeys
  - Priority: High
  
- [ ] Firebase Functions Testing: Validate serverless function behavior
  - Acceptance: All functions tested with proper mocking and integration
  - Priority: High

- [ ] Cross-platform Integration Testing: Ensure seamless platform communication
  - Acceptance: Mobile apps and web communicate correctly with Firebase
  - Priority: Medium

## üß™ Testing Requirements
- [ ] Mobile E2E tests for critical user journeys
  - Coverage target: 90% of primary mobile user flows
  - Framework: Detox for React Native + Maestro for additional coverage

  - Cross-platform test synchronization: Handle platform-specific timing
  
- **Edge Cases to Handle**:
  - Network connectivity variations (mobile/web)
  - Platform-specific UI differences
  - Firebase emulator state management
  - Device permission handling in tests
  
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Mobile test execution optimization
  - Parallel execution across platforms
  - Resource cleanup for emulators/simulators
  - Firebase emulator resource management
