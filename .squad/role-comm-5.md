# Role Communication: Data Engineer #5
## üìä Current Assignment: Mapbox Integration Analytics

### üéØ Work Session Started
**Started**: 2025-08-23 
**Focus**: Analytics and data infrastructure for Mapbox venue discovery feature

### üìã Initial Strategy
Based on role-plan-5.md, my 3-step approach:

1. **Foundation First**: Create map analytics event schema to establish tracking framework
2. **Core Metrics**: Implement user behavior analytics and venue performance tracking  
3. **Advanced Insights**: Build performance monitoring and heatmap data aggregation

### ‚úÖ Progress Updates
[2025-08-23] Starting work session - analyzing current analytics infrastructure
[2025-08-23] ‚úÖ Analyzed existing analytics infrastructure:
  - Found eventAnalyticsService.ts for event-based analytics
  - Located usePerformanceMonitoring.ts hook for Firebase Performance

  - Reviewed firebaseApi.ts patterns for data operations
[2025-08-23] ‚úÖ Created map analytics event schema (mapAnalyticsService.ts)
  - Comprehensive event types: MapViewEvent, MapInteractionEvent, VenueMarkerEvent, NavigationEvent, MapPerformanceEvent
  - Buffered processing with automatic flushing
  - Firebase Performance integration for tracing
[2025-08-23] ‚úÖ Implemented user behavior analytics tracking (userBehaviorAnalytics.ts)
  - Journey tracking from map discovery to venue interaction
  - Discovery pattern analysis with search/browse metrics
  - Engagement metrics and conversion funnel tracking
  - Session-based insights and pattern recognition
[2025-08-23] ‚úÖ Designed venue performance metrics tracking (venuePerformanceMetrics.ts)
  - View metrics with visibility tracking and duration analysis
  - Interaction metrics with contextual user behavior data
  - Discovery metrics with conversion path analysis
  - Popularity and competitive analysis features
[2025-08-23] ‚úÖ Built performance monitoring for map operations (mapPerformanceMonitoring.ts)
  - Map load performance with device and network conditions
  - Render performance tracking with frame rate monitoring
  - Interaction responsiveness measurements
  - API call performance with latency and success tracking
  - Resource usage monitoring (memory, CPU, network)
[2025-08-23] ‚úÖ Created location heatmap data aggregation (locationHeatmapAnalytics.ts)
  - Spatial data aggregation with configurable grid systems
  - Popular zone identification using flood-fill algorithm
  - Temporal pattern analysis (hourly, daily, weekly)
  - Location analytics with activity distribution insights
[2025-08-23] ‚úÖ Created comprehensive integration layer (mapboxAnalyticsIntegration.ts)
  - Unified API for all analytics components
  - Coordinated tracking across all services
  - Session management and analytics lifecycle
  - Performance summary and insights generation
