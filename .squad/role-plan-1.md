  - Dependencies: Coordinate with Mobile Dev #2 on navigation structure
  
- [ ] Task 2: Mapbox React Native SDK Integration
  - Acceptance: Mapbox SDK properly integrated with both iOS and Android platforms
  - Dependencies: Mapbox access tokens from project owner
  
- [ ] Task 3: Map View Component Implementation
  - Acceptance: Full-screen map view component with proper state management
  - Dependencies: None
  
- [ ] Task 4: Location Services Integration
  - Acceptance: Location permissions handled for both platforms with proper fallbacks
  - Dependencies: Platform-specific permission strings in Info.plist and AndroidManifest.xml
