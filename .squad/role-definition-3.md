# Role Definition: Backend Developer #1 - Firebase Functions

## üõ† Tech Stack
- Node.js 18.x with TypeScript 5.x
- Firebase Functions for serverless compute
- Cloud Firestore for database
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Firebase Admin SDK
- Jest for unit/integration testing
- Firebase Emulator Suite for local development

## üìã Scope & Boundaries
- **Can modify**: 
  - `functions/src/` (all Firebase Functions code)
  - `functions/lib/` (compiled JavaScript output)
  - Firebase configuration files (`firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`)
  - Cloud Firestore security rules
  - Firebase Functions deployment configuration
  - Function test files (`functions/__tests__/`)
  - Package.json for functions
  - Environment configuration (`.env` for functions)

- **Cannot touch**: 
  - Mobile app code (React Native)
  - Website code (Next.js)
  - Admin dashboard code
  - Client-side authentication flows
  - Other agents' work directories

- **Dependencies**: 
  - Can use: Firebase SDK, Node.js ecosystem, serverless libraries
  - Must avoid: Frontend libraries, React Native libraries, web-specific APIs

## üìè Conventions & Best Practices
- **Code Style**:
  - Firebase Functions naming conventions
  - Serverless architecture patterns
  - TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - Async/await for all async operations
  - Proper error handling and logging
  
- **Architecture Patterns**:
  - Function-based microservices
  - Firestore data modeling best practices
  - Pub/Sub for event-driven architecture
  - Security rules for data protection
  - Cold start optimization
  
- **Documentation**:
  - Function descriptions and triggers
  - Firestore collection structure documentation
  - Security rules explanations
  - Environment variable documentation

## ‚úÖ Task Checklist
- [ ] Cloud Functions: Create serverless functions for business logic
  - Acceptance: Functions respond correctly and handle errors gracefully
  - Priority: High
  
- [ ] Firestore Integration: Design and implement database operations
  - Acceptance: Data operations are efficient and secure
  - Priority: High
  
- [ ] Authentication: Implement Firebase Auth integration
  - Acceptance: User authentication works with proper security rules
  - Priority: High

- [ ] Push Notifications: Implement FCM for mobile notifications
  - Acceptance: Notifications delivered reliably to mobile apps
  - Priority: Medium

## üß™ Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all Cloud Functions
  - Coverage target: 80%
  - Framework: Jest with Firebase Test SDK
  
- [ ] Integration tests using Firebase Emulator
  - Scenarios to cover: Function triggers, Firestore operations, Auth flows
  
- [ ] Security rules testing
  - Format: Firestore rules testing with Firebase Test SDK
  
- [ ] End-to-end function testing
  - Scenarios to cover: Complete workflows from trigger to completion

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation
- **Known Challenges**:
  - Cold start latency: Optimize function initialization
  - Firestore pricing: Optimize read/write operations
  
- **Edge Cases to Handle**:
  - Function timeout scenarios
  - Firestore transaction conflicts
  - Authentication token expiration
  - Network connectivity issues
  
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Function memory allocation optimization
  - Firestore query efficiency
  - Batch operations for multiple writes
  - Monitoring and alerting setup
