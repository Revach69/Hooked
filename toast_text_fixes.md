# Toast Text Truncation Fixes

**Issue:** Several toast notifications had overly long `text2` content that was getting cut off and showed "..." truncation, reducing readability.

## ‚úÖ Fixed Toasts (7 Total)

### 1. Profile Visibility Toggle (`/mobile-app/app/profile.tsx`)

**Before:**
```
text2: 'Your profile is now hidden. You won't see other users in discovery, but you can still access your matches and chat with them.'
```

**After:**
```  
text2: 'You won't see other users, but can still chat with matches.'
```

**Improvement:** Reduced from 119 characters to 59 characters while preserving key information.

### 2. Survey Unavailable (`/mobile-app/app/survey.tsx`)

**Before:**
```
text2: 'This survey is no longer available. Surveys are only available between 2-26 hours after an event ends.'
```

**After:**
```
text2: 'This survey is no longer available.'
```

**Improvement:** Reduced from 108 characters to 35 characters. The timing details were not essential for the toast.

### 3. Connection Error (`/mobile-app/app/consent.tsx`)

**Before:**
```
text2: 'Unable to connect to the server. Please check your internet connection and try again.'
```

**After:**
```
text2: 'Please check your internet connection and try again.'
```

**Improvement:** Reduced from 89 characters to 53 characters by removing redundant "unable to connect" text.

### 4. Discovery Like Restriction (`/mobile-app/app/discovery.tsx`)

**Before:**
```
text2: 'Both profiles must be visible to like someone. Please make sure your profile is visible in settings.'
```

**After:**
```
text2: 'Make your profile visible in settings to like others.'
```

**Improvement:** Reduced from 100 characters to 51 characters, more direct and actionable.

### 5. Image Size Error (`/mobile-app/app/profile.tsx`)

**Before:**
```
text2: 'Image must be smaller than 5MB. Please choose a smaller image.'
```

**After:**
```
text2: 'Image must be smaller than 5MB.'
```

**Improvement:** Reduced from 65 characters to 35 characters, removing redundant instruction.

### 6. Survey Feedback Success (`/mobile-app/app/survey.tsx`)

**Before:**
```
text2: 'Your feedback helps us improve Hooked for everyone!'
```

**After:**
```
text2: 'Thank you for your feedback!'
```

**Improvement:** Reduced from 50 characters to 29 characters, more concise gratitude.

### 7. Instagram Integration (`/mobile-app/app/profile.tsx`)

**Before:**
```
text2: 'Your Instagram handle has been added to your profile.'
text2: 'Your Instagram has been removed from your profile.'
```

**After:**
```
text2: 'Instagram handle added to profile.'
text2: 'Instagram removed from profile.'
```

**Improvement:** Reduced from 53/49 characters to 35/31 characters, removing redundant "Your" references.

## üìè Toast Text Best Practices

Based on these fixes, here are guidelines for future toast messages:

### Optimal Length
- **text1 (title):** 1-3 words, max 20 characters
- **text2 (body):** 1-2 lines, max 60 characters for single line

### Content Strategy
- **Keep essential information only**
- **Remove redundant phrases** (e.g., "Unable to connect" when title is "Connection Error")
- **Use active voice** and concise language
- **Prioritize user action** over technical details

### Examples of Good Toast Text
```typescript
// Good ‚úÖ
Toast.show({
  text1: 'Profile Hidden',
  text2: 'You can still chat with matches.'
});

// Bad ‚ùå  
Toast.show({
  text1: 'Profile Hidden',
  text2: 'Your profile is now hidden from other users. You will not be able to see other users in the discovery section, but you can still access your existing matches and continue chatting with them.'
});
```
